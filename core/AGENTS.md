# OpenCode Agent System

Agents represent stable professional responsibilities.

They are not tied to frameworks, phases, or tools.

---

## Core Principles

- Humans decide.
- Agents execute.
- Specs define correctness.
- Skills define execution.
- Agents never own product or business decisions.

## Available Agents

| --------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| architect             | Defines and validates architecture     |
| mentor                | Advises on complex technical decisions |
| implementer           | Executes specs and architecture        |
| test-agent            | Designs quality and regression tests   |
